##sklearn has a way to export trees graphically

from sklearn.externals.six import StringIO
from IPython.display import Image
from sklearn.tree import export_graphviz
import pydotplus

#dot_data = StringIO()

#export_graphviz(dec_clipped_fit, out_file=dot_data,
                #filled=True, rounded=True,
                #special_characters=True)
#graph = pydotplus.graph_from_dot_data(dot_data.getvalue())
#Image(graph.create_png())
#graph.write_png("clipped_dec")

##Taking graph out as it takes some time to run.
## You can see that in hte min number of sample split at each one of my nodes I am allowing a split of 2. Therefore the graph will be quite
## large and not really helpful for display.

###So we get an RMSE of 38,407 for the model that just uses the Random Forest Classifier.
## THis is not good, but I guesss it depends on min and max....also we are using a decision tree..

print(min(train_df['SalePrice']))
print(max(train_df['SalePrice']))

##Right, so on a scale of 34900 and max 755000 for data, 38,407 is not really acceptable.
##Since the sample split in the tree is 2, this means it is really only spliting on itself with
##an average of the split within the last node.

##It would probably be helpful at this point to look at the data as opposed to random forest classifier.

##30,956 is the error, which is better, but still not great.
## YOu can see up above that the depth of the tree is 60 because we have a continous varaiable there are a lot of splits happening. To cut the
## tree at a low level would be bad in that it would average the prices, For accuracy sake we don't really want to do unlesss we were only
##concerned with the bin that the final price might fall into.

## I will probably stop here, 30k is about what we could get the RMSE to. This is not terrible for a decision tree using continous variables.
##This data is clearly linear, so probably not something we would do on a real world example.

##Another thing to note is that I did two variations of a decision tree, one using entropy and the other not. Python doesn't exactly have
## a direct translation.
