## Distinguishing between Two Decision Trees Using Recursive Feature Engineering


To note, the file called Model_590_Cart is not something I would normally do. An assignment I was working on called for decision trees.

The data is provided by Kaggle.

## Model 590 Cart

As mentioned, would not approach this problem typically with a decision tree, but it is something that an assignment called for.

I performed recursive feature engineering to determine which variables provided the highest gini purity.

I then used those variables in a decision tree.

The document Model_590_cart.py satisfies and assignment that I was working on. However, to actually model this problem correctly I will explore other options.

## Data Exploration

Please read through my notes in the data exploration. This was a quick walk through of the data with some feature engineering.

## Keras Example

In this file I am modeling the data with  simple MLP network using Keras.
